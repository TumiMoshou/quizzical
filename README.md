# Quizzical - Trivia Quiz App

Welcome to the Quizzical app! This solo project, which I developed as part of the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path, is a dynamic web application that allows users to test their trivia knowledge across various topics. The application fetches questions from a trivia API and provides immediate feedback on answers.
